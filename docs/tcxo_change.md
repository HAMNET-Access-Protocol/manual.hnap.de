## Changing the TCXO

The original TCXO in the Adalm Pluto has an accuracy of 25ppm. At 440MHz carrier frequency, this could result in frequency
offsets of up to 10kHz. This cannot be handled by our system.

We therefore strongly suggest to switch to a more accurate TCXO. We switched to a 0.5ppm TCXO.
