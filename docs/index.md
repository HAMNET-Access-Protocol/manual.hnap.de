### Build tutorials

There are 3 main things to build:
<ul>
<li>Build the complete [firmware image](building_the_fw) that can be flashed to the pluto.</li>
<li>Build the main basestation and client [applications](build_apps) that are run on the pluto without building the firmware.
   This is only useful if you already have flashed the firmware and want to develop on the client/basestation applications.</li>
<li>Build a [simulation target](build_simulation) that does not require the Pluto Hardware. Useful to see how the PHY and MAC layer work when developing.</li>
</ul>
